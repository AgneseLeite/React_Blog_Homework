                    These are some of the weirdest and unusual buildings
                    from all over the world. Buildings are enduring symbols of 
                    art and creativity. From the Colosseum to the Great Wall of China, 
                    great buildings usually have a huge impact on people. 
                    However, many of these buildings are more an indulgence of 
                    fantasy on the part of the architects. From turning towers to space-age 
                    domes, these fantastic places will make you wonder â€” 
                    how do these places even exist?
